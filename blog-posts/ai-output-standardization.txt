## Why AI Outputs Need to Be Standardized: The Hidden Problem in Production AI

If you’ve spent any time building with large language models, you’ve probably felt the same frustration I have. The demos are magical—ask a question, get a plausible answer. But the moment you try to build something real, something that needs to work every time, the cracks start to show.

### The Demo-to-Production Gap

When I first started integrating AI into my own projects, I was amazed at how quickly I could get something working. But as soon as I tried to move beyond the prototype, I ran into a wall. The same prompt would give me different answers on different days. Sometimes the output would be valid JSON, sometimes it would be a string with a code block, and sometimes it would just be… wrong.

This isn’t just my experience. Talk to anyone deploying AI in production, and you’ll hear the same stories:

- **Inconsistent outputs:** Even the best models can’t guarantee the same answer twice. That’s fine for a chatbot, but a nightmare for automation.
- **Validation headaches:** I found myself writing endless code to check, clean, and reformat AI outputs—just to get them into a usable state.
- **Blind retries:** When things failed, the only option was to try again and hope for the best. There was no systematic way to understand or fix the problem.
- **Tooling sprawl:** Every team I know cobbles together their own mix of validators, wrappers, and hacks. There’s no standard way to handle the basics.

### Why Does This Matter?

The reality is, most AI tools today are built for demos, not for production. They’re great at showing what’s possible, but not at delivering what’s required. And as more companies try to move AI from the lab to the real world, these problems are only going to get worse.

I’ve seen teams spend weeks debugging why a workflow failed, only to discover that the AI returned a slightly different field name, or an extra comma, or a truncated response. Multiply that by every step in a multi-stage pipeline, and you get a system that’s fragile, unpredictable, and hard to trust.

And it’s not just about technical headaches. The lack of reliability erodes trust in the entire system. If you can’t be sure what you’ll get back from the model, you start to second-guess every result. That’s a huge drag on productivity and confidence, especially as AI becomes more deeply embedded in business-critical workflows.

### The Cost of “Good Enough”

We’ve all gotten used to the idea that “AI sometimes works.” But in production, “sometimes” isn’t good enough. If you’re building a coding agent, you need code that compiles every time. If you’re generating API responses, you need them to match the schema—every time. If you’re processing documents, you need structured data you can rely on.

The lack of standardization means every team is reinventing the wheel, and every user is left wondering if they can trust the output. It slows down development, increases costs, and ultimately limits what we can build.

### What Needs to Change

I believe we need to treat AI outputs with the same rigor we apply to any other part of our infrastructure. That means:

- Defining clear, typed contracts for what we expect from the model
- Validating every response, not just hoping for the best
- Handling failures systematically, not with ad-hoc retries
- Building tools and standards that make reliability the default, not the exception

Until we do, AI will remain stuck in the demo phase—impressive, but not dependable.

### An Idea: What If We Standardized AI Outputs?

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about what it would look like to actually solve this problem. What if there was a way to define, up front, exactly what kind of output you expect from an AI model? What if every response was validated against a contract, and you could trust that the output would always be in the right shape—or at least fail in a way you could handle?

Maybe there could be a lightweight standard or toolkit for this: something that sits between your application and the model, enforcing schemas, handling validation, and making it easier to build reliable, composable workflows. Not a heavy platform, but a set of conventions and helpers that anyone could use, regardless of which provider or model they’re working with.

I don’t have all the answers yet, but I think this is a direction worth exploring. If you’ve run into these same issues, or have ideas about how to make AI more reliable in production, I’d love to hear from you.
