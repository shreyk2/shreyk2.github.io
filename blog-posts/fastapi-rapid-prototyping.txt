When I started working on internal tools for location services at Fetch, I needed to prove value in the tools I was creating. I faced a choice: stick with the company's Golang stack, or try something that would let me move faster. I chose FastAPI, and it was one of the best decisions I made.

## Why FastAPI Over "Enterprise" Languages?

The conventional wisdom says you need Go or C# for "serious" production systems. But here's the thing: **when you're building internal tools or prototypes, development speed matters more than squeezing out microseconds.**

FastAPI becomes incredibly powerful when you need to:
- Build proof-of-concepts quickly
- Iterate on changing requirements
- Integrate with multiple external services
- Focus on solving business problems

## My Experience: Location Auditor at Fetch

The location mapping system I built needed to handle:
- Partner onboarding
- Location data processing  
- Multiple external APIs (geocoding, business verification)
- Revenue tracking and analytics

### With Java/Spring, this would have meant:
- Creating multiple controllers
- Configuring dependency injection
- Writing XML/annotation configurations
- Tons of boilerplate code
- Slow feedback loop: change → recompile → restart → test → repeat

### With FastAPI, I could:
- Define endpoints with simple Python functions
- Get automatic API documentation with Swagger UI
- Use type hints for built-in validation
- Go from idea to working endpoint in **minutes, not hours**

## The Game-Changer: Easy Integration

Need to call Google Places API? `pip install requests` and write a few lines.

Want Redis caching? `pip install redis` and you're done.

The Python ecosystem meant I could focus on **solving problems** instead of fighting build systems.

## Data Processing Made Simple

For the location auditor, I needed to:
- Process receipt data
- Match against location databases
- Generate reports for revenue tracking
- Create Grafana visualizations

Python's data science ecosystem (pandas, etc.) made this trivial. In Java, I would have needed heavyweight libraries and significantly more code.

## Async Programming Without the Pain

FastAPI's async/await support made it easy to handle:
- Multiple external API calls
- Database queries
- I/O-heavy operations

No complex thread pools or callback chains like in other frameworks.

## Better Developer Experience

**Auto-generated documentation:** Team members could understand and test my APIs without separate docs or Postman collections.

**Type safety:** Pydantic models made API contracts self-documenting and automatically validated.

**Fast iteration:** Real-time updates as I modified code.

## Deployment and Operations

FastAPI applications:
- Run with minimal overhead
- Have smaller Docker images than Java apps
- Start almost instantly (vs 30-60 seconds for Spring Boot)

## When NOT to Use FastAPI

I'm not saying FastAPI should replace everything. If you're building:
- High-frequency trading systems
- Services needing millions of requests/second
- Microsecond latency requirements

Then you might need Go, Rust, or highly optimized Java.

## The Real Impact

The location auditor I built:
- Processes thousands of receipt matches per hour
- Generates real-time analytics
- Handles the load perfectly
- Was built in a fraction of the time a traditional stack would have taken

When requirements changed (and they always do), I could adapt quickly instead of refactoring complex inheritance hierarchies.

## For Startups and MVPs

FastAPI is even more compelling for rapid development:
- Go from idea to prototype in hours/days
- Automatic documentation for frontend devs
- Simple deployment story
- Get user feedback quickly

## The Key Insight

**Choose tools based on your actual constraints, not theoretical performance specs.**

In most business contexts:
- Developer productivity matters more than theoretical benchmarks
- Time-to-market is crucial
- Ability to iterate quickly is essential

FastAPI strikes the perfect balance: fast enough for real applications, incredibly productive for developers, great ecosystem, and scales when needed.

For rapid prototyping, internal tools, and projects where you need to prove value quickly, it's become my go-to choice.
