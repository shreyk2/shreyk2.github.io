My experience in Taiwan working with CQRS patterns and event-driven architecture fundamentally changed how I think about system design. Implementing Kafka clusters with Zookeeper for event sourcing taught me about the complexities of distributed systems. The separation of read and write workloads through CQRS not only improved performance but also provided better scalability patterns. Docker containerization and proper service orchestration became essential skills for managing the complexity of microservices architectures.
