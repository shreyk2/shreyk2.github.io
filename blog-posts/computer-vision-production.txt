Working on live-stream poker analysis at sidebetz.ai taught me valuable lessons about deploying computer vision models in production. PyTorch model optimization, handling variable video quality, and managing inference latency were crucial challenges. The project involved training custom OCR models to detect card values and player actions from thousands of hours of video data. Key learnings include the importance of data preprocessing, model versioning, and creating robust pipelines that can handle edge cases in real-world video feeds.
